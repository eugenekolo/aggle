# ![aggle logo](ios/icons/Icon-72.png?raw=true)         Aggle

An open source mobile application serving as an alternative to Craigslist for fast local buying, haggling, and selling for cash.  

Do you wish you could window shop from home but can't believe the extreme shipping costs on sites like etsy?!?  Wish you could browse listings on craigslist without specifying exactly what you are looking for?  Have an item that you want to sell for cash on a deadline but fear listing on craigslist will bucket your item into an obscure category that won't allow it to reach the people who might not even know they need the item in their life?  

*NO LONGER!!* Aggle allows you to snap, list, sell.  The tinder-like swipe browsing allows you to search a mix of broad categories you care about (electronics, men's clothing, women's shoes) for items you will love right around the corner from where you live!  

This project is for Boston University's course EC500 Agile Software Development for ECE Applications.
