# ![aggle logo](ios/icons/Icon-72.png?raw=true) Aggle

An open source mobile application serving as an alternative to Craigslist for fast local buying, haggling, and selling for cash.  

Do you wish you could window shop from home but can't believe the extreme shipping costs on sites like etsy?!?  Wish you could browse listings on craigslist without specifying exactly what you are looking for?  Have an item that you want to sell for cash on a deadline but fear listing on craigslist will bucket your item into an obscure category that won't allow it to reach the people who might not even know they need the item in their life?  

*NO LONGER!!* Aggle allows you to snap, list, sell.  The tinder-like swipe browsing allows you to search a mix of broad categories you care about (electronics, men's clothing, women's shoes) for items you will love right around the corner from where you live!  

This project is for Boston University's course EC500 Agile Software Development for ECE Applications.

## App Features

In our final sprint we had a huge amount of growth though everything isn't in it's final form we made more progress than any other sprint:
- Added zip code on login and local item only browsing accordingly
- Added ‘Settings’ page that pulls picture from fb and allows you to save changed zip code
- Switched from the ugly swipe function to a streamlined working view with Koloda
- Camera and picture upload now function properly, tested on phone, and take you to an item description page where you can update the database with the proper info
- Chat functionality added, then broken :(
- Added current seller listings page that shows listing after you post from images

Please see below for image examples of some of our new screens.
